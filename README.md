# At Least 55,625 Properties Under the Hammer in Real Estate Auctions — and Counting

**A data-driven research into housing financialization in Greece and the restructuring of the country by the markets, accompanied by an open dataset.**

The homeownership-driven social inclusion of the previous periods does not exist anymore. The over-indebtedness of households and enterprises following the international financial crisis had a direct impact on the economic stability of the banking sector and provided justification for the current process of property seizure, through foreclosures and auctions.

As a result, since 2014, the supposedly horizontal protection measures have been repealed and the ban on foreclosures has been abolished by the facilitation of auctions and the institution of the electronic auction platform [eauction.gr](eauction.gr) by the Notary Association of Athens, Piraeus, Aegean and Dodecanese.

In September 2019, [AthensLive](https://athenslive.gr/) published an investigation detailing these findings: ["Whose Home Is This? At Least 55,625 Properties Under the Hammer in Real Estate Auctions — and Counting."](https://medium.com/athenslivegr/whose-home-is-this-f3b45d878b0b)

To do this reporting, we looped through every property on eauction.gr to collect the relevant information and put it into a dataset of 45,918 lots that can then be analysed.

The dataset, which comes along with 22,119 items of documentation for each unique online auction in PDF and Word Doc format, in Greek language, gives open access to basic information on the identity of the debtor, including their name and VAT number, and the hastener pursuing the auction, the starting bid, the current status and date of the auction. New properties are being added on the platform on a daily basis. All cases can be tracked and counted so that journalists, activists, academics, advocates and active citizens can oversee what is going on in the platform while generating new knowledge and empowering affected communities.

The data covers the whole country and the study period is from November 18, 2017, when the first property appeared on the platform, until September 1, 2019. With this data, it is possible to isolate every property which was listed on the platform at any point in this period. Where are those 45,918 properties located and how much do they cost? How many of the auctions were actually conducted? Taking the assumption that social and economic pressures can target certain vulnerable groups, with this kind of data, we would be able to prove (or disprove) this.

We also compiled an [explanatory note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10olVcBg36pFNIUOMXnMzggP7qZ9IcmKRiV31cK7w96c/edit) on every column in our dataset.
