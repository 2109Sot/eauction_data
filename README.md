AthensLive obtained data on 45,918 private properties in Greece. Download it here.

The dataset, which comes along with 22,119 items of documentation for each unique online auction in PDF and Word Doc format, in Greek language, gives open access to basic information on the identity of the debtor, including their name and VAT number, and the hastener pursuing the auction, the starting bid, the current status and date of the auction. New properties are being added on the platform on a daily basis. All cases can be tracked and counted so that journalists, activists, academics, advocates and active citizens can oversee what is going on in the platform while generating new knowledge and empowering affected communities.

The data covers the whole country and the study period is from November 18, 2017, when the first property appeared on the platform, until September 1, 2019. With this data, it is possible to isolate every property which was listed on the platform at any point in this period. Where are those 45,918 properties located and how much do they cost? How many of the auctions were actually conducted? Taking the assumption that social and economic pressures can target certain vulnerable groups, with this kind of data, we would be able to prove (or disprove) this.
